Restriction during the auto-refine stage is usually insignificant. If desired, confirm
by comparing the ranges below to those in the *.arf file.

NOTE: unintentional restrictions encountered during the exploratory stage may be problematic,
refer to the output written at the end of the exploratory stage for relevant warnings.
