NO is the default (blank) answer to all Y/N prompts


Enter a name for this project (the name will be used as the
root for all output file names) [default = my_project]:

The problem definition file will be named: stx11.dat                                                                                           

Enter thermodynamic data file name [default = hp02ver.dat]:

Enter the computational option file name [default = perplex_option.dat]:
See: www.perplex.ethz.ch/perplex_options.html

Reading Perple_X options from: perplex_option.dat                                                                                  

The current data base components are:
 NA2O  MGO   AL2O3 SIO2  CAO   FEO  
Transform them (Y/N)? 
Specify computational mode:

     1 - Convex-Hull minimization
     2 - Constrained minimization on a 2d grid [default]
     3 - Constrained minimization on a 1d grid
     4 - Output pseudocompound data
     5 - 1-d Phase fractionation
     6 - 0-d Infiltration-reaction-fractionation
     7 - 2-d Phase fractionation (FRAC2D and TITRATE reactive transport models)

Use Convex-Hull minimization for Schreinemakers projections or phase diagrams
with > 2 independent variables. Use constrained minimization for phase diagrams
or phase diagram sections with < 3 independent variables.

Calculations with saturated components (Y/N)?

Use chemical potentials, activities or fugacities as independent
variables (Y/N)?

Select thermodynamic components from the set:
 NA2O  MGO   AL2O3 SIO2  CAO   FEO  
Enter names, 1 per line, press <enter> to finish:

The data base has P(bar)   and T(K)     as default independent potentials.
Make one dependent on the other, e.g., as along a geothermal gradient (y/n)? 

Select x-axis variable:
     1 - P(bar)  
     2 - T(K)    
     3 - Composition X_C1* (user defined)

*X_C1 can not be selected as the y-axis variable


Enter minimum and maximum values, respectively, for: T(K)    

Enter minimum and maximum values, respectively, for: P(bar)  

For gridded minimization, grid resolution is determined by the number of levels
(grid_levels) and the resolution at the lowest level in the X- and Y-directions (x_nodes
and y_nodes) these parameters are currently set for the exploratory and autorefine cycles
as follows:

stage        grid_levels  xnodes  ynodes    effective resolution
exploratory       1          60      60        60 x  60 nodes
auto-refine       4          60      60       473 x 473 nodes

To change these options edit or create the file perplex_option.dat

Specify component amounts by mass (Y/N)?

The amounts you enter next need not be normalized; regardless of units, they
define the molar amount of the system


Enter the mass  amounts of the components:
 SIO2  AL2O3 FEO   MGO   CAO   NA2O 
for the bulk composition of interest:

Output a print file (Y/N)?
  

Exclude pure and/or endmember phases (Y/N)?
Do you want to be prompted for phases (Y/N)?

Include solution models (Y/N)?
Enter the solution model file name [default = solution_model.dat]:
