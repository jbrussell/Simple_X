                             SUBDIVISION SCHEMES define the discreitization and range of compositions for a solution 
                             during a calculation. he discreitization and range of compositions for a solution 
                             during a calculation. In many cases, particularly for chemically complex solutions, 
                             this range is restricted to reduce the time and memory required for calculations. 
                             If such a restriction is encountered (**warning ver993**) during the exploratory 
                             stage of a calculation the restriction may have consequences for the final
                             auto-refine stage result. For this reason it is important for users to correct
                             the scheme (unless the restriction is intentional). A resume of warnings written
                             at the end of the exploratory stage is written to the *_auto_refine.txt file. 
                             This file should be examined before any results are accepted as final.

                             A brief description of how subdivision schemes follows (it reads worse than it is):

                             If the solution model has a simplicial composition space, then each scheme is
                             directly associated with an endmember (as identified in *_auto_refine.txt). For
                             a solution with N endmembers, there are thus N-1 subdivision schemes. In general
                             it is best to order the solution model endmembers so that the most important end-
                             member is listed last and therefore determined by difference. 

                             If the solution model has a prismatic composition space, then a scheme is
                             associated with the S-1 independent compositions of the T simplexes that comprise
                             the prism (as identified in *_auto_refine.txt). Thus for prismatic composition spaces
                             there are T*(S-1) subdivision schemes for the compositional variables X(1..T,1..S-1). 
                             X(1..T,S) is determined by difference and therefore then endmembers should be ordered 
                             so that X(1..T,S) corresponds to the most important compositional variable.

                             The subdivision scheme for each independent compositional variable is specified by 
                             four parameters, in order, XMIN, XMAX, XINC, IMOD:

                            IMOD - may be either 0 or 1:

                                IMOD = 0 - is the cartesian scheme, in which compositions are discretized with a
                                           regular spacing.
                                IMOD = 1 - is a non-linear scheme, in which compositions become more closely spaced 
                                           toward zero.

                            XINC - in most cases the value of XINC is equated to the first (exploratory stage) or
                                   second value of the initial_resolution keyword, which defaults to [1/16 1/48],
                                   i.e., the value of XINC specified within the solution model text here is irrelevant.
                                   The exceptions are if initial_resolution = [0 0] or if the solution model type = 20 
                                   (electrolytic_fluid). For these exceptions, the value of XINC is read from the model
                                   text here. XINC controls the resolution of the compositional discretization, i.e., 
                                   the number of compositions generated over the interval of interest is 1/XINC + 1 if 
                                   XINC < 0 and is XINC+1 if XINC > 0.

                            XMAX - is the maximum value of the compositional variable permitted by the scheme. This 
                                   value may be relaxed if the hard_limits option is TRUE (default).

                            XMIN - If IMOD = 0, XMIN is the minumum value of the compositional variable permitted by 
                                   the scheme. This value may be relaxed if the hard_limits option is TRUE (default).
                                   If IMOD = 1 and XMIN > 0, then XMIN is the smallest non-zero value of the compositon
                                   for statically generated compositions. Thus, the value of XMIN dictates the asymmetry
                                   of the discretization. XMIN is not relaxed if this composition becomes limiting.
                                   If IMOD = 1 and XMIN = 0, then XMIN has no significance and the asymmetry of the 
                                   discretization is specified by the stretch_factor option.

                             For convexhull minimization calculations (CONVEX) the resolution of a composition is dictated
                             entirely by the subdivision scheme and the initial_resolution option. For adaptive minimization
                             calculations (VERTEX) the resolution of statically generated compositions is controlled as in
                             convexhull calculations, but the compositional resolution for dynamically generated compositions
                             is limited by the final_resolution keyword. In particular for non-linear subdivision, this has
                             the consequence that the value of XMIN or stretch_factor should be viewed as the order of 
                             magnitude the poorest acceptable resolution.
